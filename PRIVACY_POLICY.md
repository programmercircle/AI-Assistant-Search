# Privacy Policy for AI Assistant Search

**Last Updated:** [Feb-10-2026]

## Introduction

AI Assistant Search ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles information.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not:
- Collect any personal data
- Track your browsing history
- Store your searches or queries
- Send data to external servers
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Require account creation or login

## How the Extension Works

The extension functions by:

1. **Context Menu Integration:** Adds a right-click menu option when you select text
2. **Local Storage:** Stores only your preference settings (which AI services are enabled/disabled) locally on your device using Chrome's storage API
3. **Tab Opening:** Opens the selected AI service in a new browser tab with your selected text as a URL parameter
4. **No Data Transmission:** All functionality happens within your browser. We never receive or process your data

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Third-Party AI Services

When you use this extension to access AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok, or Perplexity), you are subject to those services' respective privacy policies:

**Summary in Plain English:**

We don't collect anything. Period.

The extension just makes it easier to use AI services you already have access to. It's like a bookmark, but smarter. Everything happens in your browser, nothing goes to us or anyone else (except the AI service you choose to use).

Your privacy is 100% protected because we literally cannot see anything you do.
