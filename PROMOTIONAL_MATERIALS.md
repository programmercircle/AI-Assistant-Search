### Reddit (r/chrome, r/artificial, r/productivity):
Title: [Extension] Quick access to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other AI assistants with one right-click

Body:
Hey everyone! I built a Chrome extension that makes it super easy to use AI assistants while browsing.

Instead of copy-pasting text and switching tabs, you can:
1. Select any text
2. Right-click
3. Choose your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok, or Perplexity)
4. Get instant answers

The extension is completely free, doesn't collect any data, and uses your existing AI logins. I made it because I was tired of the constant tab-switching when researching or debugging.

Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improvement!
